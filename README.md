Designing a model for generating Fairouz-like music
A very simple 1-D CNN to generate Fairouz-like music.. check it out.
I used a small dataset of 7 midi files of Fairouz songs, retrieved from:
1. https://www.midiworld.com/search/?q=fairouz
2. http://fairuziat.com/fairouz/files/index.html
The Model can be improved further by training the CNN on more MIDI files of Fairouz songs.. Please let me know if you know where i can get more data.

here is a sample of the generated Fairouz music

You are all welcome to improve the model and add more data..
